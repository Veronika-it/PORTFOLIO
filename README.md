## Postman API Collection

I have created a Postman collection for testing Trello's API. You can view and import the collection into Postman using the link below:

This collection includes requests to manage boards, lists, cards, labels, and checklists within Trello. Each request is documented with descriptions, expected responses, and error handling details.


### About Me
